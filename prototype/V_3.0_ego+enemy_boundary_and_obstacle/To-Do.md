- mask function, pass in list of coordinates[(x_cor, y_cor)] (allow list, deny list)
- get_neighbor_4 function (get a list of map cells of only 4 neighbors)
- speed limit 
- record path for drones (step as the main time line)
[step#: (x_cor, y_cor)]

- formalize data structure for response_data {
    "step"
}

- Animation software given the sequential path for the movement

- test out the Python abstract method in the example folder

- Show path for the movement





- abstract the coordinates to coordinates class

- Algorithm contains all necessary algorithms

- !!! fix the run function for the flight.py so that it will handle the flight path of the initial step

- ~!~ Exciting! Parser that parses the STL formula

- tedious task
    - !!! convert all coordinates to the Coords object
    - use the algorithm class (instead of write one's own) to calculate robustness values

- ~!~ fly using waitpoints instead of mathemtical equations

- ~!~ ability to set the speed for each drones

- signal estmator shoudl be put in the ego drone
- !!connect STL to signal estimator

- Incorporate the concept of Radar

- [X] Finished
